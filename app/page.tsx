      {/* §01 · THE LINE. Jake, 2026-09-13, with a HeartBloom landing
          (dribbble 27394246): "can we try this but instead of that image
          in the card its my showreel and we have the itsjay effect for
          the video grow. i want a 5 star review thing somewhere too and
          we would be the white background version of course."

          Then a day of it — the chip in the title, the big card, the
          drop cap — and, with the Hyperactive pizza shot (dribbble
          25319896: a headline across the top of a big picture, words
          ON it): "im thinking the video could be dimmed so you get the
          text on top of it and when you scroll it grows and undims."
          And, on the first cut of that (the film washed light, the
          room's wide face): "it doesnt really look like the reference."
          It did not: theirs is a dark picture with LIGHT writing on it,
          a huge condensed one-line headline, and the picture's top edge
          cutting through the letters. So: one condensed uppercase line
          the width of the measure; the film DIMMED DARK with light copy
(the sprayed tags were tried and cut — Jake:
          "i dont like the tags"); the headline
          white where it crosses the film (a clipped second copy of the
          line, never a blend). On scroll the reel grows
          out of the card into the dock and the scrim lifts with it. On scroll, itsjay's grow (decodes/itsjay.md
          §5.3, measured): the reel's real home is a full-width block in
          the section right after the hero; at rest it is transformed UP
          into the chip in the line (scale ~0.13, translated to its
          centre),
          and across the first 0.9 viewports of scroll it scales and
          travels LINEARLY back to where it lives — so it grows out of
          the hero, takes the screen, and docks. No
          pin: the words leave at scroll's own rate and fade as the reel
          takes over.

          Retires the stage (d5daaf3), the lift (9cd34bc), the shutter
          (da61f3c) and the screening (b7637cd) — all of today. Kept: the
          film is there from the first frame, the minimal caption, the
          rail's wordmark as the name.

          --hero-p is measured on the WRAPPER's top edge: 0 at rest, 1
          at 0.9vh of scroll, itsjay's domain exactly. The wrapper holds
          the stage AND the dock so the reel inherits it in both. */}

          from black to white and the white aspects to go to black like
          completely flip").

          ⚠ SUPERSEDES the standing "never a light room mid-page" call
          (decisions.md, 2026-09-06) — that one was made against a light
          §04 revealed by a curtain lift, and it was the whole treatment
          he rejected on sight. This is the opposite instruction, given
          knowingly, so it wins; the old entry stays on the record.

          ONE ELEMENT OWNS THE GROUND. Every bg track writes its target
          every frame, clamped — so a track resting at progress 0 paints
          its `from` colour over everything above it, and two of them
          means the lower one wins the whole page. §04 and §05 both gave
          theirs up for this.

          The same track writes --flip, and the token block below re-mixes
          EVERY colour in the room against it — ink, surfaces, edges — so
          the inversion is one number and nothing can flip out of step
          with anything else. Its subtree is the back half, which is why
          the wrapper starts here and not at the top of the page. */}

          surfaces in the back half and the atmos/vignette factors are all

          no data-sp on this div the engine never writes --flip, every

          simply stays dark, which is exactly the page as it read before
          the flip was built.

          TO BRING IT BACK, put these eight attributes back on this div and
          change nothing else:

            data-sp data-sp-from="0.86" data-sp-to="0.3"
            data-sp-var="--flip" data-sp-target=".dr-root"
            data-sp-lerp="0.1" data-sp-step="0.03125"
            data-bg-from="void" data-bg-to="#f2f2f4"

          data-sp-target puts the value on the ROOT so the fixed light rig
          ABOVE this wrapper can read it — a var only inherits downward.
          data-sp-step is a measured perf requirement, not a preference:
          twelve color-mix tokens resolving a new colour every frame
          re-rasterise every glyph and surface on screen (2026-09-08 —
          mean 13.6ms a frame and 14 dropped, against 8.6 with --flip
          held still). Publishing at 1/32 costs nothing visible and buys
          all of it back. The GROUND deliberately does not step.

          ONE ELEMENT OWNS THE GROUND still holds, and matters more now
          than it did: §04 and §05 both gave up their own bg tracks so
          this one could have the page, so with this track gone the back
          half has NO ground ramp at all and sits on the void end to end.
          If the ending needs its lifted ground back before the flip is
          re-sited, that is §05's track to re-declare — not a second one
          here. */}
